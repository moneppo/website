The Vitus project was an entry into the [Create Digital Music / Digitopia “Dreams” Competition](http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/06/dreams-of-a-musical-future-digitopia-winners-wondrous-creations-one-will-be-real/).

I got a special mention in the “More Terrific Ideas” category – not a bad place 
considering the the crazy cool stuff that was entered at the time. Many of my
past and future electronics projects orbited around this concept, and it sparked
my interest in RF, microcontrollers, etc. 

In the years since this competition I've seen a lot of products come out that 
have elements like each of the pieces here, but it's taken a while to get to
fully wireless audio. Had I tried to pull this off a decade ago, I think I 
would have gotten seriously frustrated.
