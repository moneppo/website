Imagination Codes was a series of concepts and experiments around teaching
children about the creative arts, design thinking and leading them to be 
creative problem solvers using modern tools. We developed or conceptualized
learning modules around many of the creative arts, such as poetry, movement & 
dance, music, design thinking, communication and storytelling. 

The goal was to provide modules in two versions: offline for collaborative 
classrooms and online for self guided learning as well as classroom or group 
activities.

I worked with Amelia Winger-Bearskin to develop a prototype system for building 
online modules, targeted at teachers with less technical experience. By 
collecting a simple set of files together including text written in markdown, 
code snippets, and videos, teachers and developers alike can make online 
educational modules quickly and easily. The code, or what's left of it after the
exploration, is up on my github site. If you squint it appears a lot like Jekyll 
but with a more fixed structure to the end website that's generated.

One other fun part of Imagination Codes was developing and testing a generative 
poetry module that used color-coded words to build simple algorithms for 
creating sentences and poems. We showed this off at one of the ITP shows and
had a lot of fun generating surprisingly coherent algorithmic poetry.
